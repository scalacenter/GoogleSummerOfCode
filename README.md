If you would like to be a mentor and propose your own idea, please submit a PR editing this file (e.g. see [2024's projects](Past%20years%20ideas/2024.md)), adding your project to the list, following the format of other projects below.

## Rules

You can read the full rules of the program at the following links: [Rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules), [Terms and Conditions](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/terms/contributor), [Help](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/help).

And here are the requirements for the potential contributor's proposal: [Writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

However, here are some rules that we'd like to emphasize since they are not visible enough at the above links:

- The program is geared towards beginners first and foremost. It is intended to **be a learning experience** for people at the very beginning of their careers. It is also intended to **give an opportunity** to people who would otherwise not have one. It is NOT a freelance job. Therefore, when making an acceptance decision on a potential contributor, we will prioritize disadvantaged backgrounds and contributors at the very beginning of their careers.
- **IMPORTANT - EPFL Students**: Please note that, according to GSoC rules, there are restrictions on accepting students from an organization's host university. For Scala Center, the host university is EPFL. We can only accept up to 1 student from EPFL, so please take it into account if you're studying at EPFL and consider applying.

| Brief Description        | This project aims to implement a benchmarking framework similar to JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) allowing for accurate and reliable performance measurements on non JVM platforms. Both Scala Native and Scala.js cannot consume a modified JVM bytecode emitted by JMH framework. The goal is to create a runtime implementation for executing microbenchmarks and a Scala compiler plugin performing required transformations of Scala.js / Scala Native code based on JMH framework compiletime annotations. |
| Expected Outcome         | A benchmarking framework that mimics JMH APIs and produces reliable results for Scala Native and Scala.js. Demonstration benchmarks showcasing usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Brief Description        | This project aims to implement incremental optimization for Scala Native’s Intermediate Representation (IR), improving compilation speed by reusing results from previous compilation runs instead of optimizing the entire program from scratch. |
| Expected Outcome         | A working prototype of an incremental optimization pipeline for Scala Native IR, with measurable speedups over full optimizations.                                                                                                                |
| Prerequisites            | Strong understanding of compilers, Scala Native IR, and optimization techniques. Knowledge of LLVM and incremental compilation strategies is a plus.                                                                                              |

| Brief Description        | Python through Pandas has a great data import experience. This project aims to replicate parts of that by parsing parts of the datasource _at compile time_, i.e. bringing knowledge of the structure and headers of your datasource inside the compilers knowledge. It's goal is to help you _discover_ your data, rather than force to you to write out it's metadata in advance. It's target audience will be writing non production, data sciency type scripts. Many of the motivating examples come from kaggle.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Expected Outcome         | Can be measured in the increased number of successful test cases. I believe the "fundamental" idea has legs, but is currently limited to a small number of scenarios explored in my free time. The goal of the project is to expand the set of scenarios in which it is useful. Initial easy issues surround details such as correctly parsing headers, checking special characters, improving error messages and writing data back to (e.g. CSV). From there it should be possible to graduate to adding more datasources, for example SQL (hopefully simple - or harder, for example exploring apache parquet.) Stretch goals could include exploring strategies for streaming statistics, deriving visualisations, critiquing the design vs e.g. Kantan.csv, and / or attempting to help the consumer identify the "types" of the data at compile time. |
| Prerequisites            | Basic scala / java knowledge. The barrier to "getting started" ought to be rather low. The initial issues are largely detail driven rather than design driven. Basic experience with testing (munit), CI (GHA) and scala standard library would be enough to contribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Brief Description        | Scalus is a platform for developing full-stacke decentralized applications (DApps) on the Cardano blockchain using a single language, Scala 3, tools and code for frontend, backend and smart contracts development. Scalus implements a Scala 3 compiler backend that compiles Scala to Cardano Plutus Core – a lambda calculus inspired smart contracts language. |
| Expected Outcome         | Enable more Scala 3 features to be compiled to Plutus Core: arbitrary size Tuples, better pattern-matching conversion algorithm. Improvements in our code generator, and various lambda calculus optimizations: inliner, common subexpression eliminator etc. We also expect improvements in Scalus standard library, test coverage and documentations.             |
| Prerequisites            | Basic Scala knowledge. Basic understanding of compiler theory and blockchain technology is a plus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Brief Description        | Add support for compiler plugins in Scaladex, the index website of open source Scala artifacts. Adapt the UI of the front page, search page and project page to allow searching, and browsing compiler plugins and their versions. See full description in [scalacenter/scaladex#865](https://github.com/scalacenter/scaladex/issues/865) |
| Expected Outcome         | Scaladex should index compiler plugin artifacts, such as [org.typelevel:kind-projector_2.13.16:0.13.3](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/typelevel/kind-projector_2.13.16/0.13.3/). It should show them as a separate platform on the front page, search page and project page.                                                          |

| Brief Description        | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala. This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier. LLMs can be used in an agentic style where the LLM is allowed to call provided tools to access resources (such as reading a webpage, or calling an API service to perform a task). The goal of this project is to implement an agentic loop and basic tools supporting infrastructure within the toolkil. |
| Expected Outcome         | LLM4S should have an agentic LLM toolkit wtih, documentation, examples and basic tools such as file and webbrower usage to allow users to immediately start building agentic style applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Brief Description        | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala. This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier. Beyond simple chat use cases we want to make it easy to build LLM based apps. One of the most common facilities is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) where documents are chunked and embedded and then retrieved to provide context to the question being asked. The goal is to extend the LLM framework with RAG tools to make building RAG Search easy. |
| Expected Outcome         | LLM4S should have a RAG framework which allows integration with an embedding store. The framework should support pushing documents into external stores (e.g. Postgress with pgVector or Azure AI Search Service) and implement RAG search over the top of the store, and include documentation, examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Brief Description        | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala. This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier. LLMs support a number of modalities other than chat, e.g., image generation, voice and embeddings. The goal of this project is to extend the API created in LLM4S to create APIs for calling these other use cases. |
| Expected Outcome         | As well as chat, LLM4S LLM interface should now have support for image, voice (speech to text and text to speech) and embeddeding, giving users access to more usecases. As well as the API, we will provide examples and documentation.                                                                                                                                   |

| Brief Description        | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala. This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier. As LLM based apps grow it becomes harder to understand the application and LLM interaction flow. We want to add tracing support into the application and a UI allowing exploration of the application traces, showing the calls, spans, timing and other information to help understand the flow. |
