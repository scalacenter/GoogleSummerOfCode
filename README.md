In this document, you can find a list of ideas that are proposed by the Scala Organisation for [Google Summer of Code 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## Application

If you are interested in becoming a contributor on any idea, please reach out to your potential mentor using their email address specified with the project. You can also reach Scala Center at [scala.center(at)epfl.ch](mailto:scala.center@epfl.ch).

If you would like to be a mentor and propose your own idea, please submit a PR editing this file (e.g. see [2024's projects](Past%20years%20ideas/2024.md)), adding your project to the list, following the format of other projects below.

## Rules

You can read the full rules of the program at the following links: [Rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules), [Terms and Conditions](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/terms/contributor), [Help](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/help).

And here are the requirements for the potential contributor's proposal: [Writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

However, here are some rules that we'd like to emphasize since they are not visible enough at the above links:

- The program is geared towards beginners first and foremost. It is intended to **be a learning experience** for people at the very beginning of their careers. It is also intended to **give an opportunity** to people who would otherwise not have one. It is NOT a freelance job. Therefore, when making an acceptance decision on a potential contributor, we will prioritize disadvantaged backgrounds and contributors at the very beginning of their careers.
- **IMPORTANT - EPFL Students**: Please note that, according to GSoC rules, there are restrictions on accepting students from an organization's host university. For Scala Center, the host university is EPFL. We can only accept up to 1 student from EPFL, so please take it into account if you're studying at EPFL and consider applying.

|Brief Description       | Cyfra is a GPU runtime and a DSL that makes Scala a viable choice for GPU programming. Goal of the project is to implement support for GPU computations on data streams with focus on usability.  |
|Expected Outcome        | Cyfra should enable developers that do not have background in GPU programming to write a simple data processing pipeline in Cyfra that performs compute on GPU and efficiently manages memory. The pipeline should be interoperable with fs2. |
|Prerequisites           | Some experience with Scala, and interest to learn a bit about GPUs. |

|Brief Description       | Cyfra is a GPU runtime and a DSL that makes Scala a viable choice for GPU programming. Goal of the project is to implement a basic real-time Vulkan rendering pipeline.  |
|Expected Outcome        | Cyfra should enable developers to create programs that will render scenes from a basic one-step Vulkan pipeline in real time. It should support rendering to a window, a data stream, and a file. |
|Prerequisites           | No Scala experience is required, but basic experience with GPU programming would be helpful. |

| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Link to Project         | https://github.com/scalacenter/scaladex/ |
| Brief Description       | Add support for compiler plugins in Scaladex, the index website of open source Scala artifacts. Adapt the UI of the front page, search page and project page to allow searching, and browsing compiler plugins and their versions. See full description in [scalacenter/scaladex#865](https://github.com/scalacenter/scaladex/issues/865) |
| Expected Outcome        | Scaladex should index compiler plugin artifacts, such as [org.typelevel:kind-projector_2.13.16:0.13.3](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/typelevel/kind-projector_2.13.16/0.13.3/). It should show them as a separate platform on the front page, search page and project page. |
| Prerequisites           | Some experience with Scala and SQL. Good knowledge about HTML and css |
| Ideal Prerequisites     | Some knowledge of the Scala ecosystem, such as Scala platforms and binary versions |

### LLM4S - Implement an agentic toolkit for Large Language Models

|Title                   |                                   |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs can be used in an agentic style where the LLM is allowed to call provided tools to access resources (such as reading a webpage, or calling an API service to perform a task).  The goal of this project is to create a standard toolkit that developers can use when building agentic agents. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have a useful set of tools integrated for LLM use, such as file or web browser tools to be used by applications built with LLM4S. |
|Prerequisites           | Some exerience of Scala and LLMs. |

### Scala Native / Scala.js Projects

| Title                   | Scala Bazel Rules for Scala.js and Scala Native |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|Link to Project          | https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_scala |
|Brief Description        | This project aims to develop Bazel build rules for Scala.js and Scala Native, enabling efficient and reproducible builds for both platforms. The project will provide first-class support for Scala projects within the Bazel ecosystem, improving integration and developer experience. |
|Expected Outcome         | Functional and well-documented Bazel rules that allow compiling, testing, and packaging Scala.js and Scala Native projects. Demonstration projects showcasing usage. |
|Prerequisites            | Experience with Scala, build tools (SBT, Bazel), and Scala.js/Scala Native basics. Some familiarity with Bazel rule definitions is a plus. |
|Expected Difficulty      | Medium |
|Expected Time Commitment | Large project - 350 hours |

| Title                   | JMH-Compliant Benchmarking Framework for Scala Native & Scala.js |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|Link to Project          | [Scala Native](https://scala-native.org/) / [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) |
|Brief Description        | This project aims to implement a benchmarking framework similar to JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness)  allowing for accurate and reliable performance measurements on non JVM platforms. Both Scala Native and Scala.js cannot consume a modified JVM bytecode emitted by JMH framework. The goal is to create a runtime implementation for executing microbenchmarks and a Scala compiler plugin performing required transformations of Scala.js / Scala Native code based on JMH framework compiletime annotations. |
|Expected Outcome         | A benchmarking framework that mimics JMH APIs and produces reliable results for Scala Native and Scala.js. Demonstration benchmarks showcasing usage. |
|Prerequisites            | Good understanding of benchmarking principles, Scala Native, Scala.js, and Scala compiler plugins. Some knowledge of JMH is beneficial. |
|Expected Difficulty      | Medium |

|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Link to Project          | [Scala Native](https://scala-native.org/) |
|Brief Description        | This project aims to introduce WebAssembly (Wasm) as a new backend for Scala Native, allowing Scala Native programs to run efficiently in WebAssembly-supported environments, such serverless runtimes (via WASI) or browsers. The goal is to design an alternative to current LLVM-based backend allowing to emit Wasm directlly |
|Expected Outcome         | A functional WebAssembly backend capable of compiling Scala Native programs to Wasm, with basic runtime support and test cases demonstrating correctness. |
|Prerequisites            | Strong knowledge of Scala and compilers. Familiarity with LLVM, WebAssembly, and Scala Native’s internals is a plus. |

|Link to Project          | [Scala Native](https://scala-native.org/) |
|Brief Description        | This project aims to implement incremental optimization for Scala Native’s Intermediate Representation (IR), improving compilation speed by reusing results from previous compilation runs instead of optimizing the entire program from scratch. |
